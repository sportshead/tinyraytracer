# tinyraytracer
My own version of a [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer), using Go (targeting WASM) and HTML canvas as a frontend.

## Concepts learned/used
- **Raytracing**
- Go + Wasm
- Async/promises in Wasm
- HTML5 [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) + JS [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)s
